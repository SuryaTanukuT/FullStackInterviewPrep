## 🚀 How Stripe Works

Stripe is a **payment processing platform** that provides APIs for accepting payments, managing subscriptions, handling payouts, and more.

### Key Flow:
1. **Frontend** collects card data using Stripe Elements or Checkout.
2. **Backend** securely creates payment intents or charges via the Stripe API.
3. Stripe handles authentication, authorization, and processing.
4. Stripe sends events (via webhooks) to notify about status changes.
5. Funds are settled and paid out to the merchant's bank.

## 🛠️ How to Integrate Stripe in Node.js

1. **Install Stripe SDK**
```bash
npm install stripe
```

2. **Setup Stripe in your backend**
```js
const stripe = require('stripe')('your-secret-key');

app.post('/create-payment-intent', async (req, res) => {
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: 2000,
    currency: 'usd',
  });
  res.send({ clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret });
});
```

3. **Use Stripe Elements or Checkout in frontend** to collect card details.

## 🧾 Idempotent API: Preventing Double Payment

Stripe supports **idempotency keys** to ensure the same request is only processed once.

### Example:
```js
stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'usd'
}, {
  idempotencyKey: 'unique-key-123'
});
```

This prevents **accidental double charges** due to network retries or client-side bugs.

## 🔍 Core Payment Concepts

### ✅ Payment Gateway
Interface between customer and merchant to collect card info.

### ✅ Payment Processor
Moves money between banks and authorizes transactions.

### ✅ Tokenization
Converts card data into a secure, non-sensitive token.

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization
Confirms customer identity and ensures sufficient funds.

### ✅ Recurring Payments
Handled via **subscriptions** and **webhooks** for automated billing.

### ✅ Fraud Prevention
Stripe Radar uses machine learning to detect suspicious payments.

### ✅ Payouts & Settlements
Stripe transfers collected funds to the merchant’s bank account.

## 📡 What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are **HTTP callbacks** sent by Stripe to notify your backend about events such as:
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

---

## ⚙️ How Stripe Webhooks Work

### 🔁 Event-Driven Communication
Stripe emits events when things happen (e.g., payment success/failure).

### 🌐 Webhook Endpoints
You configure a public URL on your server to receive Stripe events.

### 🧾 Event Types
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `invoice.paid`
- `customer.subscription.created`

### 🔒 Security Measures
- Validate webhook signature using Stripe's secret.
```js
stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(payload, sigHeader, endpointSecret);
```

### 🔄 Retry Mechanism
If your server fails to acknowledge the event (2xx), Stripe retries for up to **3 days** with exponential backoff.
