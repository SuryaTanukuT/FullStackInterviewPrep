# üèóÔ∏è Top 9 Software Architecture Refactoring Techniques

Refactoring architecture improves maintainability, scalability, and performance. Here are the top techniques used in real-world systems:

---

## 1. **Modularization**
**Goal:** Break monolithic code into reusable modules.

**When to Use:** When a single codebase handles multiple unrelated concerns.

**Example:**
Before: Single file handles auth, UI, and DB logic.  
After: Split into `auth.js`, `ui.js`, `db.js`.

---

## 2. **Layered Architecture Refactoring**
**Goal:** Separate concerns into logical layers (e.g., Presentation, Business, Data Access).

**When to Use:** When code responsibilities are entangled.

**Example:**
Move database queries from controller layer to a dedicated repository layer.

---

## 3. **Microservices Extraction**
**Goal:** Extract independent functionalities from a monolith into separate services.

**When to Use:** When parts of the app scale differently or need independent deployment.

**Example:**
Extract payment logic from a monolithic e-commerce app into a separate microservice.

---

## 4. **Service Decomposition by Subdomain**
**Goal:** Refactor services based on business subdomains (DDD approach).

**When to Use:** When microservices boundaries are unclear.

**Example:**
Split a large "user-service" into "auth-service", "profile-service", and "notification-service".

---

## 5. **Database Refactoring**
**Goal:** Improve schema design, normalization, or introduce CQRS/event sourcing.

**When to Use:** When data model becomes hard to change or extend.

**Example:**
Move from a single shared user table to bounded contexts with specific schemas.

---

## 6. **Introduce API Gateway**
**Goal:** Centralize routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and API aggregation.

**When to Use:** When microservices grow and client communication becomes complex.

**Example:**
Use an API gateway to route requests to `user`, `orders`, `payments` services.

---

## 7. **Strangler Fig Pattern**
**Goal:** Gradually replace legacy systems by redirecting pieces to the new system.

**When to Use:** For incremental modernization.

**Example:**
Route some routes of a legacy monolith to new microservices via a proxy.

---

## 8. **Event-Driven Architecture Introduction**
**Goal:** Decouple services using asynchronous communication via events.

**When to Use:** When synchronous APIs cause tight coupling and latency issues.

**Example:**
Use RabbitMQ or Kafka for publishing order creation events to inventory and billing services.

---

## 9. **Introduce Circuit Breaker and Retry Patterns**
**Goal:** Increase resilience in distributed systems.

**When to Use:** When dependent services are flaky or slow.

**Example:**
Use a circuit breaker in your HTTP client to fail fast and retry with exponential backoff.

---

üß† **Tip:** Always accompany refactoring with regression tests and monitoring for stability.
