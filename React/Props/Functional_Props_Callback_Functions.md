## 3. 🔁 Functional Props (Callback Functions)

### 🧠 Explanation
**Functional props** are functions passed down from a parent to a child component. They enable the child component to **trigger behavior** or **send data back** to the parent, often used in response to user interactions (like clicks or input changes).

---

### 🧪 Code Example

```jsx
function Button({ onClick, label }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}

// Parent Component
function App() {
  const handleClick = () => alert('Button clicked!');
  
  return <Button onClick={handleClick} label="Click Me" />;
}
```

In this example, the `Button` component is reusable and doesn’t care what `onClick` does—it simply calls it. The parent decides the behavior.

---

### 📖 Scenario

Imagine a reusable `Button` component that you want to use in multiple places. By passing in different functions via props, you can make the same button trigger different actions depending on context.

---

### ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Encapsulation:** Keeps child components clean and behavior-agnostic.
- ✅ **Reusability:** Same component can have many uses with different logic.
- ✅ **Decoupling:** Separates UI logic from business logic.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Prop Drilling:** Can become cumbersome when passing callbacks deeply.
- ❌ **Performance Pitfalls:** If not memoized, function props can cause re-renders.

---

### 📌 When, Why, and Where to Use

- **When:** Any time a child needs to **trigger logic** defined in the parent (e.g., onClick, onChange, onSubmit).
- **Why:** To make components flexible, reusable, and interactive.
- **Where:**
  - Form elements
  - Buttons
  - List items with actions (edit, delete)
  - Modal close handlers
  - Pagination controls

---

### 🧯 Polyfill / Compatibility

- ✅ **No polyfill needed.**
- ✅ Fully supported in all versions of React.
- 🔁 For performance: Use `useCallback` to memoize callbacks if passing to deeply nested or frequently re-rendered components.

```jsx
const memoizedHandler = React.useCallback(() => {
  // logic here
}, []);
```
```
