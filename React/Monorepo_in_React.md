# 📦 Monorepo in React Projects

A **Monorepo (Monolithic Repository)** is a single repository that stores code for multiple projects/packages (e.g., frontend apps, backend services, shared libraries) — rather than maintaining separate repositories for each.

## 📁 Example Folder Structure (React-focused)

```bash
my-monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                # React App
│   └── admin-dashboard/    # Another React App or Next.js
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                 # Reusable UI components
│   ├── utils/              # Shared utilities/helpers
│   └── config/             # Shared configuration files
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── turbo.json / nx.json / lerna.json  # (Tool-specific config)
└── tsconfig.json
```

## ❓ Why Use a Monorepo

- Centralized **version control** and dependency management.
- Easier **code sharing** (e.g., UI kits, utils).
- Simplified **collaboration** between teams.
- Consistent linting, testing, and CI/CD across projects.

---

## ⏱️ When to Use a Monorepo

- Multiple React apps share components or logic.
- You want **atomic changes** across apps (e.g., update a UI lib and app together).
- You're scaling teams or products with many moving parts.

## ⚙️ How to Use (Popular Tools)

| Tool        | Features |
|-------------|----------|
| **Turborepo** | Fast build/caching, remote caching, TypeScript ready |
| **Nx**        | Advanced tooling, generators, task scheduling |
| **Lerna**     | Easy publishing and versioning (less active now) |
| **Yarn Workspaces** | Native support for monorepos with simple setup |
| **pnpm Workspaces** | Faster installs, strict versioning |
| **Rush.js**   | Enterprise-grade monorepo support |

---

## ✅ Pros

- Shared libraries reduce duplication.
- Unified testing, linting, CI/CD flows.
- Atomic commits across projects.
- Easier refactoring at scale.

---

## ❌ Cons

- Initial setup complexity.
- Tooling/configuration overhead.
- CI/CD complexity for large repos.
- Access control is harder (no per-project repo permissions).

---

## 🔗 Integrations & Use Cases

- **Turborepo + Vercel**: Great for deploying frontend-heavy monorepos.
- **Nx + Jest/Storybook**: For enterprise-scale codebases.
- **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI**: Selective builds using affected modules.
- **TypeScript**: Share types and configs across projects.
