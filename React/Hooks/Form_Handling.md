# 📝 5. Form Handling in React

## 📖 Explanation

Form handling in React often uses **state hooks** to build **controlled components**. This means form inputs derive their values from state, and update that state on user interaction.

For more complex forms, libraries like **Formik** and **React Hook Form** leverage hooks to provide:

- Built-in validation
- Error management
- Field registration and lifecycle

---

## 💻 Code Example

```jsx
function SimpleForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = React.useState({ username: '', email: '' });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form submitted:', formData);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Username:
        <input name="username" value={formData.username} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <br />
      <label>
        Email:
        <input name="email" value={formData.email} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## 📘 Scenario

A basic registration or login form where user inputs (like username and email) are captured, validated, and submitted to an API.

---

## ✅ Pros

- **Control**: You manage the state, validation, and behavior.
- **Predictable State**: All input values live in React state (single source of truth).
- **Customizable**: Easy to hook into validation, submission, or formatting logic.

---

## ⚠️ Cons

- **Boilerplate**: Manually managing each field and handler can get repetitive.
- **Performance**: Large forms may cause re-renders on every keystroke if not optimized.

## 🧠 When, Why, and Where

| Use Case                     | Why Use Hooks?                              |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Login/Signup forms           | Capture, validate, and submit data          |
| Search/Filters               | Control input values for filtering content  |
| Surveys/Quizzes              | Track user input across multiple questions  |

- **When**: Anytime user input needs to be tracked or validated.
- **Why**: Hooks provide fine-grained control and a consistent data flow.
- **Where**: Across all user-facing input components — forms, filters, wizards, etc.

---

## 🛠 Polyfill / Compatibility

- ✅ No specific polyfill needed for native form handling.
- For older browser support, use **Babel** or consider libraries like **Formik** or **React Hook Form** (which offer compatibility and features out of the box).
