### 3. Dynamic Forms

#### Explanation

- **Concept**: Dynamic forms are forms where the structure—such as the number of fields, types of inputs, or the validation rules—changes based on user interactions or external data. This approach is highly flexible, enabling forms to adapt in real-time to user input, such as adding new fields or sections based on previous responses.

#### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Dynamic forms allow for adaptable structures that can change based on conditions, making them ideal for scenarios like surveys or dynamic questionnaires.
- **Customizable**: The form can adjust to user input or external factors, offering a personalized experience.
- **Real-Time Changes**: Users can see the form evolve without needing to reload or manually add new elements.

#### Code Example

```jsx
function DynamicForm() {
  const [fields, setFields] = React.useState([{ name: '', value: '' }]);

  const handleFieldChange = (index, e) => {
    const newFields = fields.slice();
    newFields[index][e.target.name] = e.target.value;
    setFields(newFields);
  };

  const addField = () => {
    setFields([...fields, { name: '', value: '' }]);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form Data:', fields);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {fields.map((field, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <input
            name="name"
            value={field.name}
            placeholder="Field Name"
            onChange={(e) => handleFieldChange(index, e)}
          />
          <input
            name="value"
            value={field.value}
            placeholder="Field Value"
            onChange={(e) => handleFieldChange(index, e)}
          />
        </div>
      ))}
      <button type="button" onClick={addField}>Add Field</button>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

#### Scenario

A **survey builder** where an admin can dynamically add or remove questions. As the admin builds the survey, the form adapts in real-time to include new fields. This dynamic behavior is particularly useful when the number of questions in the survey is not fixed.

#### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:
- **Highly Flexible**: Forms can evolve in real-time based on user input, which is ideal for cases like surveys, dynamic questionnaires, and customizable forms.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Allows a variety of field types (e.g., text fields, checkboxes, selects) to be dynamically rendered.
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can interact with the form in a fluid and intuitive manner.

**Cons**:
- **Increased Complexity**: As the form structure changes, it can make state management more complex.
- **Validation Challenges**: Dynamic forms require careful handling of validation rules to ensure consistency and accuracy as the form evolves.
- **Testing Difficulty**: Since the form structure can change, testing can become more challenging, particularly when there are dependencies between fields.

#### When, Why, and Where to Use

**When**: Use dynamic forms when:
- The form structure must change based on user input or external conditions.
- You need to adapt the form in real-time based on the user’s selections or data coming from an API.

**Why**: To create a highly flexible UI that adapts to different use cases (e.g., building custom surveys, forms with conditional fields).

**Where**:
- **Admin panels**: Where admins can dynamically create or modify content, such as building a form, survey, or questionnaire.
- **Survey tools**: For gathering responses where new questions or fields need to be added based on previous answers.
- **Complex data entry forms**: In apps that require users to input dynamic data, such as multi-step or multi-stage forms.

#### Polyfill/Compatibility

- **Polyfill**: No dedicated polyfill required for dynamic forms, but you should ensure your project is set up to use **Babel** for ES6+ support.
- **Compatibility**: Works in all modern browsers. As with most modern React features, ensure backward compatibility if you're targeting older browsers.

### Summary

Dynamic forms are essential for building adaptable and user-friendly forms that can change based on the context or user interactions. While they offer excellent flexibility and customization, they also come with increased complexity, especially in terms of state management, validation, and testing. Use dynamic forms in applications where you need real-time adaptability, such as surveys, admin dashboards, or multi-step forms with changing requirements.

# useAsync in React 🚀

> A complete guide to understanding `useAsync` — a powerful way to manage asynchronous operations in React cleanly and declaratively.

---

## 📌 What is `useAsync`?

`useAsync` is a **custom React hook** (not part of React core) used to handle **asynchronous operations** like fetching data, file loading, etc. 

It manages:
- ✅ Loading state
- ✅ Success (resolved) state
- ✅ Error state

It's typically used via libraries like:
- [`react-async`](https://docs.react-async.dev/)
- Or you can write your own custom `useAsync` hook.

---

## 💡 Why use `useAsync`?

Async logic in React usually involves multiple `useState` and `useEffect` calls, making your components bloated.

**Traditional way:**

```js
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const res = await fetch('/api/data');
      const result = await res.json();
      setData(result);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

**With `useAsync`:**

```js
import { useAsync } from "react-async";

const loadData = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("/api/data");
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(res.statusText);
  return res.json();
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useAsync({ promiseFn: loadData });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
};
```

Cleaner and more declarative!

## ⚙️ Hook API Breakdown

```js
const {
  data,
  error,
  isPending,
  isLoading,
  isFulfilled,
  isRejected,
  run,
  reload,
} = useAsync({
  promiseFn,
  watch,
  deferFn,
  onResolve,
  onReject
});
```

| Field / Function | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `data`           | Resolved value |
| `error`          | Error if thrown |
| `isLoading` / `isPending` | Boolean while loading |
| `isFulfilled`    | Async was successful |
| `isRejected`     | Async threw error |
| `run()`          | Manually start deferred promise |
| `reload()`       | Re-run `promiseFn` |
| `promiseFn`      | The async function to run |
| `deferFn`        | Defer run until manually triggered |
| `watch`          | Dependency array like in `useEffect` |
| `onResolve`      | Callback on success |
| `onReject`       | Callback on error |

## 🎯 When, Why, Where

### ✅ When to Use
- You have any async operation (API, file, delay).
- You want a **neat** async lifecycle handler.

### ❓ Why Use It
- Avoids boilerplate.
- Manages async status clearly.
- Improves **separation of concerns**.

### 📍 Where to Use
- In functional React components.
- Dashboards, profile pages, dynamic UIs.
- Custom hooks for reusable async logic.

---

## 🛠️ Write Your Own `useAsync` Hook

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useAsync = (asyncFunction, deps = []) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;
    setLoading(true);

    asyncFunction()
      .then((res) => isMounted && setData(res))
      .catch((err) => isMounted && setError(err))
      .finally(() => isMounted && setLoading(false));

    return () => { isMounted = false };
  }, deps);

  return { data, isLoading, error };
};
```
