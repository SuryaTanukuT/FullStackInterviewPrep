# 🏗️ Monorepos Design Patterns in React

A **monorepo** (monolithic repository) is a single codebase that manages multiple projects. In the React ecosystem, monorepos help organize multiple apps, libraries, and shared utilities under one structured architecture.

## 📁 Typical Folder Structure

```bash
my-monorepo/
├── apps/                   # Multiple React apps
│   ├── marketing/
│   └── dashboard/
├── packages/               # Shared libraries
│   ├── ui/                 # Shared UI components
│   ├── hooks/              # Custom reusable hooks
│   └── config/             # ESLint, TS configs, etc.
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── turbo.json / nx.json / lerna.json
└── .github/workflows/      # CI/CD configs
```

## 🌟 Common Design Patterns

### 1. **Modularization**
- Split logic into reusable packages like `@project/ui`, `@project/utils`.
- Encourages code reuse and separation of concerns.

### 2. **Code Ownership per App**
- Teams own their respective apps and packages.
- Independent deployment and CI pipelines per app.

### 3. **Centralized Dev Configs**
- Share ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configs across projects.
- Reduces duplication and enforces consistency.

### 4. **Atomic Commits**
- Commit and release features across apps and packages simultaneously.
- Avoid broken changes with coordinated releases.

### 5. **Selective CI/CD Execution**
- Tools like Nx or Turborepo support **affected-based builds**.
- Only test/build what changed.

## 🚀 Tooling

| Tool             | Purpose                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Turborepo**    | Fast builds, remote caching, TypeScript ready |
| **Nx**           | Advanced monorepo orchestration        |
| **Yarn Workspaces** | Native package linking              |
| **pnpm Workspaces** | Fast dependency resolution          |
| **Lerna**        | Legacy tool for versioning/publishing  |

---

## ✅ Benefits

- Shared code and libraries reduce duplication.
- Easier dependency and version management.
- Better collaboration across teams.
- Scalable project architecture.

---

## ❌ Challenges

- Initial setup complexity.
- Requires strong tooling and CI configuration.
- Changes in shared libraries may impact multiple apps.

---

## 🔌 Integrations

- **Vite/Next.js/CRA**: All supported in monorepos.
- **Storybook**: For shared UI components.
- **Jest/Cypress**: Testing at app/package level.
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**: Run per project basis.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Use clear naming conventions (`@org/ui`, `@org/hooks`).
- Keep packages small and focused.
- Use TypeScript project references.
- Automate dependency linking and builds with Nx or Turborepo.

## 📌 Summary

| Pattern                | Purpose                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Modular Packages       | Separation of concerns                   |
| Shared Libraries       | Code reuse (UI, hooks, utils)            |
| Central Configs        | Linting/formatting consistency           |
| Isolated Deployment    | Build and deploy independently           |
| Atomic Changes         | Make consistent updates across projects  |

A well-structured React monorepo boosts **developer productivity**, ensures **code quality**, and supports **scalable app development**.
