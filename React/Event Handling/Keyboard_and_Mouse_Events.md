# Keyboard & Mouse Events in React

## Explanation
React fully supports standard **keyboard** and **mouse events** through its `SyntheticEvent` system, providing a cross-browser API to handle user interactions efficiently.

---

## Examples

### **1. Mouse Event**
This example tracks the mouse position as it moves within a specified area:

```javascript
function MouseTracker() {
  const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    console.log(`Mouse position: (${e.clientX}, ${e.clientY})`);
  };

  return (
    <div
      onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
      style={{ height: '200px', border: '1px solid #ccc' }}
    >
      Move your mouse here
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **2. Keyboard Event**
This example logs every key pressed in an input field:

```javascript
function KeyPressInput() {
  const handleKeyPress = (e) => {
    console.log(`Key pressed: ${e.key}`);
  };

  return <input type="text" onKeyPress={handleKeyPress} />;
}
```

## How It Works
- **Event Handlers**:
  Attach React event listeners (e.g., `onMouseMove`, `onKeyPress`) as props to HTML elements.
  
- **SyntheticEvent**:
  React wraps native browser events using a unified `SyntheticEvent` system, ensuring cross-browser consistency and access to event properties like `clientX` and `key`.

---

## Scenario
- **Interactive Drawing App**:
  Track mouse movements to draw shapes or lines on a canvas.
  
- **Form Input Validation**:
  Log or validate key presses to handle form inputs dynamically or implement shortcuts.

---

## Pros and Cons

### **Pros**
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of interactions for both mouse and keyboard.
- **Consistency**: Provides a unified API (`SyntheticEvent`) across all event types, simplifying development.

### **Cons**
- **Complexity**: Handling multiple event types in complex UIs can add to code intricacy.
- **Performance**: High-frequency events like `onMouseMove` may require optimization techniques such as throttling or debouncing.

## When, Why, and Where to Use

### **When**:
- When user input is required via the keyboard or mouse.

### **Why**:
- To enhance user interaction with dynamic UIs (e.g., drawing tools, game controls, or interactive forms).

### **Where**:
- Games, drawing applications, interactive forms, or other feature-rich user interfaces.

## Polyfill/Compatibility
- **Polyfill**: No special polyfill is required, as Reactâ€™s SyntheticEvent system abstracts cross-browser differences.
- **Build Compatibility**: Ensure ES6+ and modern JavaScript features are supported through tools like Babel.
