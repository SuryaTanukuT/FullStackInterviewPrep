2. Event Handler Functions

Explanation

Event handler functions are defined separately (outside the JSX) and then referenced in the event attributes.

Example

function ClickableButton() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  };
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

How It Works

Separating the handler helps with readability and potential reuse.

Scenario

Consider a dashboard where several buttons trigger different actions. Defining named functions makes it easier to manage complex logic.

Pros and Cons

Pros:

Readability: Keeps JSX cleaner by separating logic.

Reusability: Handler functions can be reused or passed as props.

Performance: Avoids creating inline functions on each render.

Cons:

Boilerplate: Requires extra lines of code, which might be overkill for trivial actions.

When, Why, and Where to Use

When: For components with multiple interactions or complex logic.

Why: Improves maintainability and performance.

Where: In larger components, dashboards, and shared UI libraries.

Polyfill/Compatibility

No special polyfill is needed; this is standard JavaScript function usage.
