# Event Handler Functions

## Explanation
Event handler functions are defined separately (outside the JSX) and then referenced in the event attributes. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and performance by separating logic from the JSX markup.

---

## Example

```javascript
function ClickableButton() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  };
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

## How It Works
Separating the handler function from JSX helps improve readability and allows the handler to be reused. By defining the event handler outside of JSX, you can easily manage and maintain complex logic or pass the handler function down as a prop to child components.

---

## Scenario

Consider a **dashboard** where several buttons trigger different actions (like opening dialogs, loading data, or toggling views). Defining named functions makes it easier to manage and modify the event handling logic, especially when the actions are more complex.

---

## Pros and Cons

### **Pros**
- **Readability**: Keeps JSX cleaner by separating logic from markup, making the code easier to understand.
- **Reusability**: Named handler functions can be reused across different components or passed as props to child components.
- **Performance**: Avoids creating inline functions on each render, improving performance, especially in larger components.

### **Cons**
- **Boilerplate**: Requires additional lines of code to define the function, which could be considered overkill for simple actions.

## When, Why, and Where to Use

### **When**:
- For components with **multiple interactions** or **complex logic** that needs to be handled in separate functions.
- In scenarios where performance optimization is important (e.g., avoiding inline functions on each render).

### **Why**:
- Improves **maintainability** by making code easier to read and update.
- Enhances **performance** by reusing handler functions, especially in larger components.

### **Where**:
- In **larger components**, **dashboards**, or **shared UI libraries** where multiple components or buttons share similar logic.

## Polyfill/Compatibility

- No special polyfill is needed as this is standard JavaScript function usage.
