3. Synthetic Events

Explanation

React’s SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser wrapper around the native event. It provides a consistent interface for handling events regardless of the browser.

Example

function SyntheticButton() {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    console.log(event.type); // "click"
  };
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

How It Works

React normalizes events so that you don't need to worry about browser differences.

Scenario

In a multi-browser enterprise app, using SyntheticEvents ensures that the same code works across all environments without manual adjustments for IE, Chrome, Firefox, etc.

Pros and Cons

Pros:

Consistency: Same API across browsers.

Performance: Uses event pooling to optimize memory usage.

Cons:

Event Pooling: Events are reused, so accessing properties asynchronously may fail unless you call event.persist().

Abstraction: Developers must learn the abstraction over native events.

When, Why, and Where to Use

When: In all React applications; Synthetic Events are used by default.

Why: To simplify cross-browser compatibility.

Where: Everywhere you handle events in React.

Polyfill/Compatibility

No polyfill is necessary for Synthetic Events—they're built into React's event system.
