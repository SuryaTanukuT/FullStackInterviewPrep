## 🧩 4. Specific Feature Error Boundaries

### 🎯 **Explanation**
Specific feature error boundaries are **locally scoped** to isolate errors within a **particular component or feature**, rather than the whole application.  
This allows fine-grained control and improves user experience for **mission-critical but fragile areas** like forms, charts, or third-party integrations.

---

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

- **Wrap only the target component** (not the entire app).
- Use **custom fallback UIs** tailored to that feature.
- Same lifecycle methods: `getDerivedStateFromError()` + `componentDidCatch()`.

---

### 💡 **Code Example**

```jsx
function PaymentForm({ paymentData }) {
  if (!paymentData) {
    throw new Error("Payment data is missing.");
  }
  return <div>Processing Payment...</div>;
}

function Checkout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Checkout</h2>
      <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️ Payment error. Please try again later.</p>}>
        <PaymentForm paymentData={null} />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> 🔁 You could even offer retry buttons or contact links in the fallback UI.

---

### 📘 **Scenario**

In an e-commerce **checkout page**, only the `PaymentForm` might fail due to:
- backend issues,
- invalid data,
- or third-party payment service outages.

Instead of crashing the entire `Checkout`, a **feature-level error boundary** shows a clear message only in that section.

---

### ✅ **Pros and ❌ Cons**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| ✅ **Scoped errors**: Avoids global fallbacks for local issues | ❌ **Error boundary sprawl**: Too many wrappers can clutter code |
| ✅ **User-friendly fallbacks**: Tailored to the feature | ❌ **Error inconsistency**: Might handle similar errors differently |
| ✅ **Better UX for critical flows** (e.g., payments, uploads) | ❌ Slightly more boilerplate per feature |

---

### 📌 **When / Why / Where to Use**

- **🕐 When**:
  - Specific components are known to occasionally fail.
  - You want to isolate risk without affecting the entire UI.

- **🎯 Why**:
  - Better user feedback and error recovery.
  - Prevent small issues from breaking big workflows.

- **📍 Where**:
  - Forms (e.g., **login**, **payment**, **file upload**)
  - **Third-party SDKs** (e.g., Stripe, Maps)
  - **Charts**, **analytics**, **complex data visualizations**

---

### 🧠 Pro Tips

- Combine with **logging error boundaries** for visibility.
- Use **dynamic fallbacks** — e.g., pass error details or retry handlers.
- Keep a consistent **error boundary pattern** across your app to avoid confusion.
