# 🧩 Microfrontends in React

**Microfrontends** is an architectural style where a frontend app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "micro-apps" working loosely together — similar to microservices on the backend.

## 📁 Example Folder Structure

```bash
microfrontends-root/
├── container/            # Shell/Host application
│   └── src/
├── products/             # Micro App 1 (React App)
│   └── src/
├── cart/                 # Micro App 2 (React App)
│   └── src/
├── shared/               # Common components or utilities
├── package.json
└── webpack.config.js     # Module federation setup
```

## ❓ Why Microfrontends

- Independent team ownership.
- Codebase isolation for scalability.
- Incremental upgrades and deployment.
- Faster release cycles with reduced risk.

---

## ⏱️ When to Use

- Large teams working on distinct frontend features.
- Multiple products or apps combined in one interface.
- Need for independent deployment of frontend modules.
- Migrating from legacy to modern frontend architecture.

## ⚙️ How to Use (Popular Tools)

| Tool               | Use Case |
|--------------------|----------|
| **Webpack Module Federation** | Load micro-apps dynamically at runtime |
| **Single-SPA**                | Routing, orchestration across micro-apps |
| **Nx or Turborepo**           | Organize microfrontends in a monorepo |
| **Web Components**            | Share UI across microfrontends |
| **Vite/RSPack**               | Alternative to Webpack for smaller MFE |

---

## ✅ Pros

- Decoupled deployment & independent development.
- Polyglot: teams can choose their stack/version.
- Fault isolation — one app's failure won’t crash the others.
- Faster onboarding for new developers.

---

## ❌ Cons

- Increased complexity in orchestration.
- Bundle size may grow due to shared dependency duplication.
- More complex routing and shared state.
- Requires solid CI/CD and module federation management.

---

## 🔌 Integrations

- **Webpack Module Federation** for runtime composition.
- **Single-SPA** for multiple frameworks.
- **Nx or Turborepo** to manage as monorepo.
- Shared state with **Redux**, **Zustand**, or via context bridge.

## 🆚 Microfrontends vs Monorepo vs Single Folder

| Feature                | Microfrontends             | Monorepo                          | Single Folder App            |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Architecture           | Decentralized              | Centralized, multi-package        | Single app                   |
| Deployment             | Independent per app        | Usually coordinated               | All at once                  |
| Teams                  | Independent                | Shared but structured             | One team                     |
| Tech Stack             | Can vary per micro app     | Usually consistent                | One tech stack               |
| Scalability            | High (team/product level)  | Medium to High                    | Low                          |
| Complexity             | High                       | Medium                            | Low                          |
| Use Case               | Enterprises, multiple UIs  | Shared libraries, multi apps      | Small to medium apps         |

## 🧠 Summary

Use **microfrontends** when you need true independence in development and deployment across features or teams. Use a **monorepo** if you need modularity and shared libraries but want to keep the apps closer. Use **single-folder apps** for simplicity and quick delivery.
