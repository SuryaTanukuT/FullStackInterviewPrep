Here‚Äôs your section on **Higher-Order Components (HOC)** formatted for a polished GitHub-style `README.md`, consistent with the rest:

## 4. Higher-Order Components (HOC)

### üß† What They Are
A **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with **enhanced behavior**.  
HOCs allow **code reuse** and **separation of concerns** by abstracting common logic‚Äîlike logging, authentication, or data fetching‚Äîinto reusable wrappers.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Code Example

```jsx
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function (props) {
    console.log('Rendering with props:', props);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
const EnhancedComponent = withLogger(MyComponent);
```

---

### üìò Scenario

You're building a large app and want to **log props** of multiple components during development.  
Instead of modifying each component, you wrap them with `withLogger()`‚Äîa reusable HOC‚Äîso the logging happens automatically.

---

### ‚úÖ Pros and ‚ùå Cons

**Pros:**
- üîÅ **Code Reuse:** Extract shared logic into a single function.
- üßº **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps components focused and decluttered.

**Cons:**
- üßÖ **Wrapper Hell:** Multiple HOCs can deeply nest your component tree.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Naming Conflicts:** Must manage `props` carefully to avoid clashes.

---

### üìç When, Why, and Where to Use

**üìÖ When to Use:**
- When multiple components require the **same logic or behavior** (e.g., auth, tracking, error handling).

**ü§î Why Use:**
- To **avoid duplication** and **maintain consistency** across components.

**üìç Where to Use:**
- In features like:
  - ‚úÖ Authentication
  - üìà Logging
  - üõ†Ô∏è Error boundaries
  - üì° Data fetching wrappers

---

### üß∞ Polyfill / Compatibility

- ‚úÖ No polyfill needed.
- üì¶ HOCs are just **standard JavaScript functions + JSX**.
- Compatible with all versions of React.

---

> ‚ö° Pro Tip: Prefer **Hooks** for most modern use cases. HOCs still shine when enhancing class components or applying logic across many components cleanly.
