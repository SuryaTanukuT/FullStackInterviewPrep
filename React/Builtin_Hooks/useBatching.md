# 🔄 React `useBatching` – In-Depth Guide

React automatically **batches state updates** to optimize performance. While there’s no official `useBatching` hook, the concept of batching is built into React (especially React 18+).

This guide explains what batching is, how it works, real-world examples, comparisons, pros & cons, and where/why/when to use it.

---

## 📌 What is `useBatching`?

> **Batching** means grouping multiple state updates into a single re-render to improve performance and consistency.

React 18 introduced **automatic batching for all updates**, including asynchronous ones (`setTimeout`, Promises, etc.).

## 🧠 React 17 vs React 18 Batching Behavior

| Feature                            | React 17           | React 18           |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Batching in Event Handlers         | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes             |
| Batching in `setTimeout`, Promises | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes             |
| Manual Batching Needed             | 🧰 Sometimes       | 🔄 Rarely          |
| Performance                        | ⚠️ Less Optimized  | 🚀 Highly Optimized |

## 🧪 Example Scenario

### Without Batching (React 17):
```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState("Hello");

  const handleClick = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
      setText("Updated");
      // Causes 2 re-renders in React 17
    }, 1000);
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

### With Batching (React 18):
Same code, but React 18 **automatically batches** both updates → **only one re-render**.

---

## 🔧 Manual Batching with `unstable_batchedUpdates`

Useful in **React 17** or when working with **external libraries**.

```jsx
import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from 'react-dom';

socket.on("message", (msg) => {
  unstable_batchedUpdates(() => {
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, msg]);
    setUnread(prev => prev + 1);
  });
});
```

---

## 📦 Real-world Scenario: Chat App

Imagine a live chat app:

### Updates Without Batching
```js
socket.on("message", (msg) => {
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, msg]);
  setUnread(prev => prev + 1); // Two re-renders in React 17
});
```

### Updates With Batching (React 18+)
Automatically batched → **1 re-render**

### With Manual Batching (React 17)
```js
unstable_batchedUpdates(() => {
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, msg]);
  setUnread(prev => prev + 1);
});
```

## 🧰 When / Why / Where to Use Batching

### ✅ When
- Multiple state updates together
- Asynchronous operations: `setTimeout`, `fetch`, `socket`, etc.
- External event callbacks

### 💡 Why
- 🔄 Reduce unnecessary renders
- ⚡ Improve performance
- 🎯 Keep UI state consistent

### 🌍 Where
- ✅ Inside event handlers (auto-batched)
- ✅ Async callbacks (React 18+)
- ⚠️ External libs (manually batched in React 17)

---

## ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

### ✅ Pros
- 🚀 Performance boost
- 🎨 Smoother UI
- 💡 Cleaner state logic

### ❌ Cons
- 🧪 Harder debugging (multiple updates merged)
- 🧠 Careful update sequencing needed
- 🔧 Manual work in React 17
