Concurrent Reconciliation (React 18+)
Explanation:

Concurrent Reconciliation, enhanced in React 18, allows React to interrupt, pause, and resume rendering work. It prioritizes user interactions over background tasks.

How It Works:
React’s new concurrent features let you mark non‑urgent updates using APIs like startTransition and useTransition. It also includes improved automatic batching.

Scenario:

In a real‑time collaboration tool, while a large document is being rendered, if the user types or clicks a button, those interactions are processed immediately, and rendering resumes afterward.

Pros:

Improves UI responsiveness by prioritizing critical updates.

Reduces jank in complex applications.

Cons:

More complexity in understanding and debugging rendering behavior.

Some libraries may not yet be fully compatible with concurrent features.

When/Why/Where:

When: In large-scale, interactive apps where responsiveness is critical.

Why: To ensure user interactions are handled immediately even during heavy rendering.

Where: In dashboards, collaborative applications, and data‑intensive tools.

Polyfill/Compatibility:

No specific polyfill is needed. Requires React 18+ for full concurrent capabilities; ensure Babel transpiles modern JavaScript.
