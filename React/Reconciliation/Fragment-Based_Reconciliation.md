Fragment-Based Reconciliation
Explanation:

React Fragments allow grouping multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They help keep the component tree flat and optimize reconciliation by reducing unnecessary wrappers.

Scenario:

A component that returns multiple adjacent elements without a parent container. Fragments prevent extra <div> wrappers, making reconciliation faster.

Pros:

Cleaner DOM structure.

Reduces overhead by not adding extra nodes.

Cons:

Limited in terms of attributes (only supports key in the long form).

When/Why/Where:

When: When grouping adjacent elements without an extra DOM element.

Why: To optimize the DOM and reconciliation.

Where: In list rendering, component returns, etc.

Polyfill/Compatibility:

Supported in React 16.2+; no polyfill is needed.
