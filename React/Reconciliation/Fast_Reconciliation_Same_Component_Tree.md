Fast Reconciliation (Same Component Tree)
Explanation:

When the component tree remains the same (i.e., the same type of elements in the same order), React performs a fast reconciliation. It reuses the existing DOM nodes and simply updates the changed properties or content.

Scenario:

A user profile component where only the user's name or status changes. The structure remains identical, so React quickly updates text content without recreating DOM elements.

Pros:

Very efficient since minimal work is done.

Low overhead, as only updated attributes are patched.

Cons:

Limited to cases where the element types and order remain unchanged.

When/Why/Where:

When: Updates within a stable, unchanging structure.

Why: To minimize updates and improve performance.

Where: In dashboards, profile pages, or any component with minimal structural change.

Polyfill/Compatibility:

No polyfill is needed—this is core to React’s virtual DOM diffing algorithm.
