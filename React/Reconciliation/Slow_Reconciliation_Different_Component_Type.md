Slow Reconciliation (Different Component Type)
Explanation:

When the component type changes (for example, replacing a <div> with a <span>), React cannot reuse the previous DOM node and must destroy the old node and create a new one.

Scenario:

A conditionally rendered component that switches between completely different UI layouts (e.g., a login form vs. a registration form that use different HTML tags).

Pros:

Ensures that the rendered output exactly matches the new component type.

Cons:

More expensive because the old tree is discarded and a new one is built.

Can lead to a perceptible delay if large subtrees are replaced.

When/Why/Where:

When: When the component’s type changes drastically.

Why: To accurately reflect different UI requirements.

Where: In conditionally rendered views that change structure significantly.

Polyfill/Compatibility:

No polyfill is required; this is part of React’s diffing mechanism.
