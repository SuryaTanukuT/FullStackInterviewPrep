Module Pattern
In Node.js, the term “Module Pattern” can refer to two distinct but related concepts:

Revealing Module Pattern: A design pattern for encapsulating private variables and methods within a module while exposing a public API, promoting code organization and modularity.
Node.js Module System: The built-in mechanism for structuring code into reusable modules, enabling code sharing, dependency management, and code organization across projects.
Revealing Module Pattern
Key Use Cases

Organizing code into logical units
Encapsulating private implementation details
Controlling exposure of public members
Avoiding global namespace pollution
Code Sample

const myModule = (function() {
  // Private variables and methods
  const privateVar = 'secret';

  function privateMethod() {
    console.log('This is a private method');
  }

  // Public methods exposed as the module API
  return {
    publicMethod: function() {
      privateMethod();
      console.log('This is a public method');
    },
  };
})();

myModule.publicMethod(); // Output: "This is a private method", "This is a public method"
console.log(myModule.privateVar); // Error: privateVar is not accessible
Pros

Encapsulation: Protects internal implementation details, promoting modularity and maintainability.
Modularity: Organizes code into self-contained units, improving readability and reusability.
Avoids Global Namespace Pollution: Prevents unintended conflicts with other variables and functions.
Flexibility: Allows customizing the public API by returning specific members.
Cons

Boilerplate Code: Requires an IIFE and explicit return statement, potentially adding verbosity.
Limited Scope Control: Variables declared within the IIFE are technically accessible within the module, blurring the line between truly private and exposed members.
Testing Private Members: Requires special techniques or test runners to access and test private members.
Not Modern Syntax: While still widely used, not aligned with modern ES module syntax that offers built-in scoping.
Node.js Module System
Key Features

Organizing code into files or directories
Exporting desired members using module.exports
Importing modules using require()
Managing dependencies between modules
Code Sample

// module1.js
module.exports = {
  message: 'Hello from module 1',
};

// module2.js
const module1 = require('./module1');
console.log(module1.message); // Output: "Hello from module 1"
Pros

Simplicity: Cleaner syntax using module.exports and require(), eliminating the need for IIFEs.
Clear Scoping: Built-in module scope ensures clear separation between public and private members.
Ease of Testing: Easier to test both public and private members using standard testing frameworks.
Modern Syntax: Aligns with modern ES module syntax, promoting consistency and familiarity.
Cons

Limited Flexibility: Public API is defined by exported members, offering less control compared to custom return objects in the Revealing Pattern.
Global Dependencies: Requires careful management of global dependencies to avoid conflicts.
Potential Namespace Issues: If not namespaced correctly, modules might still introduce namespace pollution in large projects.
