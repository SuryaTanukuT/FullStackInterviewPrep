The Strategy pattern allows you to dynamically swap between different algorithms for the same operation at runtime. Imagine having multiple ways to perform a task, where the specific approach depends on context or user preferences. The Strategy pattern lets you encapsulate each algorithm into separate “strategy” objects, enabling flexible switching based on various factors. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and adaptability in your Node.js applications.

Key Use Cases
Data processing: Employing different sorting or filtering algorithms depending on data size or requirements.
Routing: Implementing context-aware routing strategies based on user roles, request types, or other criteria.
Validation: Using various validation strategies for different data types or input sources.
Caching: Choosing different caching algorithms based on expected access patterns and performance needs.
Error handling: Adopting specific error handling strategies for different error types or application components.

Basic Implementation with Interface

interface OrderProcessingStrategy {
  processOrder(order): void;
}

class StandardProcessingStrategy implements OrderProcessingStrategy {
  processOrder(order) {
    // Implement standard processing logic
    console.log(`Processing order ${order.id} using standard strategy.`);
  }
}

class RushProcessingStrategy implements OrderProcessingStrategy {
  processOrder(order) {
    // Implement rush processing logic (e.g., prioritize, expedite)
    console.log(`Processing order ${order.id} using rush strategy.`);
  }
}

class OrderProcessor {
  constructor(private strategy: OrderProcessingStrategy) {}

  process(order) {
    this.strategy.processOrder(order);
  }
}

// Usage
const standardProcessor = new OrderProcessor(new StandardProcessingStrategy());
const rushProcessor = new OrderProcessor(new RushProcessingStrategy());

standardProcessor.process({ id: 123 }); // Uses standard processing
rushProcessor.process({ id: 456 }); // Uses rush processing
Context-Based Strategy Selection

const strategies = {
  standard: new StandardProcessingStrategy(),
  rush: new RushProcessingStrategy(),
};

function getStrategy(order) {
  // Determine strategy based on order priority or other criteria
  if (order.priority === 'high') {
    return strategies.rush;
  } else {
    return strategies.standard;
  }
}

const processor = new OrderProcessor(getStrategy({ id: 789, priority: 'high' })); // Selects rush strategy based on priority
processor.process({ id: 789 });
Pros
Flexibility: Choose and change algorithms dynamically based on context or needs.
Modularity: Encapsulate different algorithms into independent, reusable strategies.
Maintainability: Easier to modify, test, and extend individual strategies without affecting the core logic.
Testability: Each strategy can be tested independently.
Cons
Increased complexity: Introduces additional classes and management overhead.
Potential performance overhead: Runtime strategy selection might add slight overhead.
Overdesign risk: Not every situation requires the dynamic flexibility of the Strategy pattern.
