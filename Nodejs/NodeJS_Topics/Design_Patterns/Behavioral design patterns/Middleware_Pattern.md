Middleware pattern
The Middleware pattern enables you to chain functions sequentially to process requests or responses within frameworks like Express.js. Each middleware function acts as a layer in the processing pipeline, potentially modifying the request or response object, making additional asynchronous calls, or terminating the request-response cycle. This pattern promotes modularity, reusability, and flexibility in handling various aspects of web requests.

Key Use Cases
Authentication & authorization: Verifying user credentials and enforcing access control.
Data parsing & validation: Extracting and validating data from requests before processing.
Error handling & logging: Intervening and handling errors while logging request/response details.
Content modification & manipulation: Pre-processing or post-processing request/response data.
Caching & performance optimization: Implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
Code Samples
Basic Middleware Function

function loggingMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`Request URL: ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
}

app.use(loggingMiddleware); // Apply middleware globally
Chained Middleware with Data Manipulation

function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Verify user token (simulated)
  if (isValidToken(req.headers.authorization)) {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
}

function parseBodyMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Parse JSON body if present
  req.body = JSON.parse(req.body);
  next();
}

app.post('/users', authMiddleware, parseBodyMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // Handle user creation with validated data
});
Pros
Modularity: Breaks down request processing into reusable, focused functions.
Flexibility: Easily add, remove, or reorder middleware for different functionalities.
Decoupling: Components handling distinct concerns are separate, promoting maintainability.
Testability: Middleware functions can be individually tested in isolation.
Separation of concerns: Promotes clear separation between core application logic and request/response handling.
Cons
Potential performance overhead: Chained middleware can add processing time, especially with many functions.
Nested callback hell: Unmanaged call chains can lead to complex and hard-to-read code.
Debugging complexity: Tracking issues across multiple middleware functions can be challenging.
