Iterator Pattern
The Iterator Pattern in Node.js provides a standardized way to traverse and access elements within a collection sequentially, without exposing the internal structure of the collection. It achieves this by encapsulating the traversal logic within an “iterator” object, which implements the Iterator protocol (or the Symbol.iterator method) with a next() method that returns the next element or signals completion. This promotes loose coupling, modularity, and efficient collection processing in your Node.js applications.

Key Use Cases
Processing large collections: Efficiently iterating over large datasets without loading everything into memory at once.
Lazy evaluation: Delaying the actual work of retrieving elements until they are needed.
Customizing iteration logic: Creating custom iterators that define specific traversal behaviors.
Chaining operations: Performing multiple operations (e.g., filtering, mapping) on iterators in sequence.
Interoperability: Using iterators with built-in functions and libraries that expect iterables.
Code Samples
Basic Iterator Implementation

class MyArrayIterator {
  constructor(array) {
    this.array = array;
    this.index = 0;
  }

  next() {
    if (this.index < this.array.length) {
      const value = this.array[this.index];
      this.index++;
      return { value, done: false };
    } else {
      return { done: true };
    }
  }
}

const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const iterator = new MyArrayIterator(myArray);

for (const element of iterator) {
  console.log(element); // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4
}
Chaining with Built-in Iterators

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); // Use filter iterator
const doubledNumbers = evenNumbers.map(num => num * 2); // Use map iterator

console.log(doubledNumbers.join(', ')); // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Pros
Loose coupling: Decouples collection access from its internal structure.
Modularity: Encapsulates iteration logic for reusability.
Flexibility: Enables custom iteration behaviors and composability with other patterns.
Efficiency: Avoids loading entire collections into memory for large datasets.
Interoperability: Works with many built-in functions and libraries.
Cons
Potential over-engineering: Not every simple iteration requires a formal iterator.
Learning curve: Understanding the pattern and protocol usage might require initial effort.
Additional Notes
ES6 introduces built-in Symbol.iterator and iterators for many data structures.
Consider other patterns like Generators (similar to iterators but more flexible) depending on your needs.
