Dependency Injection Pattern
The Dependency Injection (DI) pattern promotes loose coupling between objects by decoupling the creation and management of an objectâ€™s dependencies from its internal logic. Instead of directly creating or requiring its dependencies, the object receives them as arguments or through configuration. This enables flexible testing, easier maintenance, and promotes modularity in your Node.js applications.

Key Use Cases
Testing: By injecting mock dependencies, you can isolate and test individual units of code effectively.
Flexibility: The ability to swap dependencies at runtime allows for dynamic configuration and adapting to different environments.
Maintainability: Loose coupling simplifies code changes and promotes reusability of components.
Modularity: Dependencies are explicitly defined, enhancing clarity and understanding of component interactions.
Extensibility: New dependencies can be easily added without modifying existing code significantly.
Code Samples
Constructor Injection

class UserService {
  constructor(userRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
  }

  getUser(userId) {
    return this.userRepository.findById(userId);
  }
}

// Usage
const userRepository = new InMemoryUserRepository(); // Concrete implementation
const userService = new UserService(userRepository);
Setter Injection

class OrderService {
  constructor() {
    this.paymentProcessor = null;
  }

  setPaymentProcessor(paymentProcessor) {
    this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
  }

  processOrder(order) {
    this.paymentProcessor.processPayment(order);
  }
}

// Usage
const paymentProcessor = new StripePaymentProcessor(); // Concrete implementation
const orderService = new OrderService();
orderService.setPaymentProcessor(paymentProcessor);
orderService.processOrder({ ... });
Dependency Injection Container

const container = require('tsyringe');

container.register('UserRepository', { useClass: InMemoryUserRepository });
container.register('UserService', { useClass: UserService });

// Usage
const userService = container.resolve('UserService');
const user = userService.getUser(1);
Pros
Loose coupling: Promotes testability and maintainability by decoupling objects from concrete implementations.
Flexibility: Enables dynamic configuration and adaptability to different environments.
Testability: Facilitates isolated unit testing by injecting mock dependencies.
Modularity: Enhances code clarity and understanding of component interactions.
Extensibility: Simplifies adding new dependencies without modifying existing code significantly.
Cons
Increased complexity: Introducing containers or additional logic might add complexity.
Learning curve: Understanding DI concepts and frameworks might require initial effort.
