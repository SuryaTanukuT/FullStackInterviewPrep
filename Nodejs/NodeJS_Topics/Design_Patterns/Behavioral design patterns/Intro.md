Design patterns represent established, generalized solutions to commonly recurring problems encountered during software development. They are not pre-written code, but rather conceptual blueprints or templates adaptable to various contexts.

Employing design patterns offers numerous benefits, including:

Reusable solutions: Proven approaches to common problems, saving time and effort.
Improved code quality: Increased clarity, maintainability, and flexibility.
Enhanced communication: Shared vocabulary and understanding among developers.
Behavioral design patterns address interactions and responsibilities within object-oriented systems. Unlike structural patterns focusing on object composition, these patterns define how objects communicate and collaborate.

The key uses of behavioral patterns are:

Decoupling: Objects interact indirectly, reducing dependencies and enhancing flexibility.
Communication: Patterns establish efficient message passing mechanisms between objects.
State management: Some patterns define how objects handle internal state changes and trigger external responses.
