Stream Pattern
The Stream pattern in Node.js enables efficient handling of large datasets or continuous data flows. It provides an abstraction for both reading and writing data chunks (“chunks”) sequentially over time, avoiding loading the entire dataset into memory at once. This is particularly useful for processing large files, network connections, or real-time data like audio or video streams.

Key Use Cases
Large file processing: Processing large files in parts without overwhelming memory usage.
Network I/O: Streaming data from or to network connections efficiently.
Real-time data processing: Handling continuous data streams like audio, video, or sensor data.
Piping/chaining operations: Composing various data processing operations on streams seamlessly.
Backpressure control: Efficiently handle cases where data production outpaces consumption.
Code Samples
Basic File Reading with Stream

const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('large_file.txt');

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  // Process data chunk by chunk
  console.log(`Read chunk: ${chunk.toString()}`);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading file.');
});
Writing to a Stream

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writeStream.write('This is data written to the stream.');
writeStream.write('Another chunk of data.');

writeStream.end(() => {
  console.log('Finished writing to file.');
});
Chaining Streams with Pipes

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
const transformStream = require('./myTransformStream'); // Custom stream for data transformation
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readStream.pipe(transformStream).pipe(writeStream); // Chain streams for processing and writing
Pros
Efficient memory usage: Processes data in chunks avoiding large memory loads.
Scalability: Handles large datasets or continuous data flows effectively.
Modular processing: Enables chaining of different data processing operations.
Backpressure control: Manages situations with uneven data production/consumption rates.
Event-driven: Highly efficient for asynchronous and non-blocking operations.
Cons
Increased complexity: Requires understanding streams and event-driven programming.
Potential performance overhead: Stream creation and management can have slight overhead.
Not suitable for all data: Random access or small datasets might not benefit significantly.
