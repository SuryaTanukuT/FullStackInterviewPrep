Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. This means there will only ever be one instance of that class throughout the application, ensuring global access to its properties and methods. This pattern is often used for services or resources that need to be shared and accessed consistently across different parts of your application.

Key Use Cases
Configuration settings: Storing and providing access to global configuration settings.
Logging services: Maintaining a central logging instance for unified logging practices.
Caching mechanisms: Implementing a single cache instance for efficient data retrieval.
Database connections: Managing a single database connection for improved resource management.
State management: Providing a consistent way to access and modify application state.
Code Samples
Basic Implementation

class Singleton {
  static instance = null;

  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = this;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Singleton instance already exists!');
    }
  }

  someMethod() {
    // Implement your method logic here
  }
}

const instance1 = Singleton.instance; // Throws error, as no instance exists yet.
const instance2 = new Singleton(); // Creates the first instance.
const instance3 = new Singleton(); // Throws error, as instance already exists.

console.log(instance2 === instance3); // Output: true
Using Module Caching

module.exports = (function() {
  let instance = null;

  return {
    getInstance() {
      if (!instance) {
        instance = new Singleton();
      }
      return instance;
    },
  };
})();

const instance1 = module.exports.getInstance();
const instance2 = module.exports.getInstance();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // Output: true
Pros
Global access: Provides a single point of access to the objectâ€™s functionality.
Shared state: Ensures consistency across the application by having a single state instance.
Resource management: Can help manage resources like database connections efficiently.
Simplified testing: Easier to test singleton behavior due to the single instance.
Cons
Tight coupling: Can lead to tight coupling between different parts of the application.
Testability limitations: Testing interactions with other parts of the application can be challenging.
Debugging complexity: Issues can be harder to trace due to the centralized nature.
