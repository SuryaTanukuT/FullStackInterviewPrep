## Introduction
Pipelining in Node.js refers to a method of chaining data processing steps where the output of one function (or stream) becomes the input of the next. It is especially useful when working with streams or processing pipelines.

---

## What is Pipelining?
In the context of JavaScript/Node.js:
- **Functional Pipelining**: Composing a series of functions to process data.
- **Stream Pipelining**: Connecting readable and writable streams so that data flows through a chain.

Pipelining is a design pattern promoting modularity and performance.

---

## Why Pipelining is Used
- Efficient **data flow** handling, especially large datasets
- Reduced **memory usage** by using streams
- Simplified and modular **function composition**
- Improves **readability and maintainability** of data processing code
- Enables **asynchronous and non-blocking** execution

---

## When and Where Pipelining is Used
- File processing (e.g., compressing, transforming, reading/writing)
- Data transformation in APIs (e.g., ETL pipelines)
- Real-time data flow (e.g., logs, streaming APIs)
- Functional programming in business logic

---

## Types of Pipelining
1. **Stream Pipelining**
   - Using Node.js streams to process data chunks efficiently.
2. **Function Composition Pipelining**
   - Composing multiple functions using higher-order functions.
3. **Async Pipelining**
   - Using `async/await` or Promises for asynchronous pipelines.
4. **Command-line Pipelining**
   - Combining system-level processes using child processes and piping.

---

## Core Methods and APIs
- `stream.pipeline()` — Safely pipe streams together.
- `stream.pipe()` — Connects readable to writable streams.
- `stream.finished()` — Handles stream completion/errors.
- Functional composition using utilities like lodash/fp or custom utilities.

```js
const { pipeline } = require('stream');
const fs = require('fs');
const zlib = require('zlib');

pipeline(
  fs.createReadStream('input.txt'),
  zlib.createGzip(),
  fs.createWriteStream('output.txt.gz'),
  (err) => {
    if (err) console.error('Pipeline failed', err);
    else console.log('Pipeline succeeded');
  }
);
```

---

## Pipelining Use Cases
- **Log processing**: Streaming log files, compressing and saving.
- **ETL processes**: Extract-transform-load pipelines using streams.
- **Web servers**: Streamlining request processing, e.g., compression middleware.
- **Audio/video processing**: Transcoding files using piped commands (e.g., `ffmpeg`).

---

## Alternatives to Pipelining
- Manual chaining of callbacks (more verbose, error-prone)
- Batch processing (not memory-efficient)
- Using temporary files instead of streams
- Event-driven architectures with custom event emitters

---

## Pipelining Flows with Examples
### 1. Stream-Based File Compression
```js
const { pipeline } = require('stream');
const fs = require('fs');
const zlib = require('zlib');

pipeline(
  fs.createReadStream('largefile.txt'),
  zlib.createGzip(),
  fs.createWriteStream('largefile.txt.gz'),
  (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Compression done');
  }
);
```

### 2. Function Composition Pipelining
```js
const pipe = (...fns) => (x) => fns.reduce((v, f) => f(v), x);

const double = x => x * 2;
const square = x => x * x;

const process = pipe(double, square);

console.log(process(3)); // Output: 36
```

### 3. Async/Await Pipelining
```js
const pipeAsync = (...fns) => x =>
  fns.reduce((p, f) => p.then(f), Promise.resolve(x));

const getUser = async id => ({ id, name: 'Alice' });
const getPosts = async user => ({ ...user, posts: ['Post1', 'Post2'] });

const pipeline = pipeAsync(getUser, getPosts);

pipeline(1).then(console.log);
```

---

## Best Practices
- Always handle errors using callbacks or `try/catch`.
- Use `stream.pipeline` over `pipe()` for better error handling.
- Break processing into small, composable steps.
- Use backpressure support in streams to avoid memory bloat.
- Monitor performance when piping large data.

---

## Conclusion
Pipelining is a powerful and versatile pattern in Node.js, enabling efficient data handling, stream processing, and modular function composition. Understanding both the functional and stream-based approaches allows developers to write scalable, performant, and maintainable applications.
