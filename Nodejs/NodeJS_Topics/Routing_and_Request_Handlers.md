## Introduction
Routing is the process of defining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint. Request handlers define the logic that runs when a particular route is hit.

In Node.js, routing and request handling are essential for building HTTP APIs and web applications.

---

## Why Routing and Request Handlers Matter
- Define how HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) are processed
- Modularize business logic for different parts of an application
- Provide scalability and maintainability

---

## When and Where They Are Used
- Creating RESTful APIs
- Serving HTML files or templates
- Processing form submissions
- Creating single-page apps with client-server communication

---

## Types of Routing
1. **Static Routing** – Fixed path to handler (e.g., `/about`)
2. **Dynamic Routing** – Parameters in routes (e.g., `/user/:id`)
3. **Nested Routing** – Organizing routes by feature/module
4. **Wildcard Routing** – Catch-all routes like `*`

---

## Request Handler Types
1. **Synchronous Handlers** – Direct response to the client
2. **Asynchronous Handlers** – Usually involve I/O like DB queries or APIs
3. **Middleware Handlers** – Used to process requests before reaching the final route

---

## Core Concepts and Methods
### Node.js Core `http` Module
```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/' && req.method === 'GET') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Welcome to Home Page');
  }
});

server.listen(3000);
```

### Express Routing Basics
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Home'));
app.post('/submit', (req, res) => res.send('Form Submitted'));
app.put('/update/:id', (req, res) => res.send(`Updating ${req.params.id}`));
```

---

## Routing and Request Handling Flows with Examples

### Example: Basic Express Routing
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'Alice' }]);
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  const user = req.body;
  res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created', user });
});

app.listen(4000, () => console.log('Server running on 4000'));
```

### Example: Dynamic Route with Parameters
```js
app.get('/user/:userId', (req, res) => {
  const { userId } = req.params;
  res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
});
```

### Example: Using Middleware as Request Handlers
```js
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);
```

## Alternatives and Frameworks
- **Koa** – Lightweight and modern alternative to Express
- **Fastify** – High-performance framework
- **Hapi** – Powerful configuration-based routing
- **Restify** – Optimized for building REST APIs
- **Next.js / Nuxt.js** – Full-stack frameworks for SSR apps

---

## Best Practices
- Use Express Router for modularizing route handlers
- Keep route definitions clean and readable
- Validate incoming data using libraries like Joi or Zod
- Use async/await with proper error handling
- Group routes by resource (RESTful design)
- Avoid deeply nested route structures

---

## Conclusion
Routing and request handling are the foundation of any Node.js server or API. Whether using the built-in `http` module or frameworks like Express, mastering these concepts ensures scalability, maintainability, and robustness of backend applications.
