## 🔹 Input Validation and Sanitization

**Input validation** is the process of ensuring that data provided by users is correct and appropriate. **Input sanitization** ensures that potentially dangerous characters in input are removed or encoded to prevent attacks like **XSS** or **SQL Injection**.

### 🔑 Types of Input Validation

| Type                        | Description                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Type Checking**            | Ensure the input matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, string) |
| **Length Checking**          | Validate that input does not exceed acceptable length or fall below minimum length |
| **Range Checking**           | Ensure numerical input falls within an acceptable range (e.g., age should be between 18 and 120) |
| **Whitelist Validation**     | Check input against a predefined set of valid values (e.g., country codes) |
| **Blacklist Validation**     | Check input against a list of known dangerous or forbidden values |

### 🔑 Sanitization Methods

| Method                       | Description                                        |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **HTML Encoding**            | Convert characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` to their HTML equivalents to prevent XSS |
| **Escaping Input**           | Escape special characters in user input that could be interpreted as code (e.g., `alert('XSS')` should become `alert(&#39;XSS&#39;)`) |
| **Removing Dangerous Characters** | Strip out characters that can cause harm (e.g., `<`, `>`, `/`, `\`) |

### Example: Input Validation and Sanitization in Node.js

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const xss = require('xss');

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/comment', (req, res) => {
  let sanitizedComment = xss(req.body.comment); // Sanitizing input using XSS library
  res.send(`Comment received: ${sanitizedComment}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## 🔹 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**SSRF** occurs when an attacker forces a server to make requests to an internal or external resource that it shouldn't have access to, potentially allowing unauthorized access to internal services, databases, or network resources.

### 🔑 SSRF Protection Strategies

| Strategy                       | Description                                        |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Restrict outbound requests**  | Prevent servers from making outgoing requests to internal resources unless necessary |
| **Validate URLs**               | Ensure that all URLs in requests are from allowed external sources and not internal IP ranges |
| **Limit services exposed**      | Avoid exposing internal services (e.g., databases, internal APIs) to the internet |
| **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** | Use a WAF to inspect and block malicious requests that might trigger SSRF |

### Example: Preventing SSRF in Node.js

```js
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

app.post('/makeRequest', (req, res) => {
  const { url } = req.body;

  // Restrict to only trusted domains (e.g., example.com)
  if (!url.startsWith('https://example.com')) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid URL');
  }

  axios.get(url)
    .then(response => res.send(response.data))
    .catch(err => res.status(500).send('Error fetching URL'));
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## 🔹 Server-Side JavaScript Injection

**Server-Side JavaScript Injection** is a type of attack where malicious JavaScript code is injected into a server-side process, which is then executed by the server.

### 🔑 Protection Strategies for JavaScript Injection

| Strategy                        | Description                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Use a Secure Template Engine** | Use template engines (like `EJS`, `Pug`) that automatically escape user data |
| **Avoid `eval()`**              | Never use `eval()` or `new Function()` as they allow arbitrary code execution |
| **Validate and Sanitize Inputs** | Ensure that inputs are properly validated and sanitized before being used in server-side processes |

## 🔹 Subresource Integrity (SRI)

**SRI** is a security feature that ensures resources (like JavaScript or CSS files) loaded from external servers are delivered without unexpected changes. It helps prevent attacks such as **man-in-the-middle (MITM)**.

### 🔑 How SRI Works

SRI allows the browser to verify that files fetched from external sources have not been tampered with by checking their **cryptographic hash**.

### Example: Implementing SRI in HTML

```html
<script src="https://example.com/script.js" integrity="sha384-abc123..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

- `integrity` contains the hash of the resource, ensuring it matches the expected content.

## 🔹 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**CORS** is a security feature implemented by browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to domains other than their own, preventing malicious websites from interacting with your API.

### 🔑 CORS Protection Strategies in Node.js

| Strategy                       | Description                                        |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Whitelist Trusted Origins**   | Only allow specific domains to access your resources via `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` |
| **Set CORS Headers Appropriately** | Ensure that CORS headers are configured to allow safe cross-origin communication (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted.com`) |
| **Allow Specific HTTP Methods** | Restrict which HTTP methods are allowed for cross-origin requests (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.) |

### Example: Setting Up CORS in Node.js (Express)

```js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

// Allow only requests from trusted domain
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://trusted.com'
}));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## 🔹 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**CSRF** is an attack that tricks an authenticated user into submitting a request to a server on which they are already authenticated, potentially performing unwanted actions.

### 🔑 CSRF Protection Strategies

| Strategy                      | Description                                        |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens**       | Generate a unique token for each user and attach it to forms to verify the request is legitimate |
| **Check the Referer Header**   | Verify that the request originates from a trusted domain |
| **SameSite Cookies**           | Use the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to prevent them from being sent with cross-origin requests |

### Example: CSRF Protection with Tokens in Node.js (Express)

```js
const csrf = require('csurf');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });

app.get('/form', csrfProtection, (req, res) => {
  res.send(`<form action="/submit" method="POST">
              <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="${req.csrfToken()}">
              <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>`);
});

app.post('/submit', csrfProtection, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Form submitted successfully');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## 🔹 Feature Policy / Permission Policy

**Feature Policy** (also known as **Permission Policy**) allows you to control which features or APIs can be used in the browser by your site. It can help prevent the use of potentially dangerous features.

### 🔑 Example: Enabling/Disabling Browser Features

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Disable camera and geolocation APIs
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('Permissions-Policy', 'camera=(), geolocation=()');
  next();
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```
