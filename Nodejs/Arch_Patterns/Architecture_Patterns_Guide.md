# Architectural Patterns for React, Angular, and Node.js

## 1. MVC (Model-View-Controller)

**How it works:**  
- **Model**: Manages data and business logic (e.g., database).
- **View**: Renders UI (HTML, components).
- **Controller**: Handles input/events and updates model/view.

**Use in:**
- **Node.js**: Express MVC using routers (controllers), Mongoose (models), and views (e.g., EJS or API responses).
- **React/Angular**: Less common directly, but controller logic appears in components/services.

**Pros:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand and implement

**Cons:**
- Not reactive by default
- Can grow messy in large apps

## 2. MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

**How it works:**  
- **Model**: Manages data
- **View**: Pure UI, passive
- **Presenter**: Coordinates between View and Model

**Use in:**
- **Angular**: Can be implemented via smart (presenter) and dumb (view) components.
- **React**: Presenter pattern with container and presentational components.

**Pros:**
- Better testability (presenter is isolated)
- View is simple and reusable

**Cons:**
- More boilerplate
- Communication overhead

---

## 3. MVI (Model-View-Intent)

**How it works:**  
- **Intent**: User actions
- **Model**: State and logic
- **View**: Rendered based on model state

**Use in:**
- **React**: Redux follows MVI (actions → reducers → state → view)
- **Angular**: NgRx is an MVI architecture.

**Pros:**
- Unidirectional flow (easy to debug)
- Predictable state changes

**Cons:**
- Learning curve
- Verbose setup

---

## 4. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

**How it works:**  
- **Model**: Data
- **ViewModel**: Binds data and UI logic
- **View**: Bound to ViewModel

**Use in:**
- **Angular**: Forms + services = ViewModel concept
- **React**: Implemented using hooks/custom hooks/state management

**Pros:**
- Two-way binding in Angular
- Clean UI logic separation

**Cons:**
- Two-way binding can cause hidden dependencies
- Debugging complex bindings is harder

---

## 5. VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router)

**How it works:**  
- Modular architecture mainly used in iOS, rarely in web.
- Could be adapted using services + router modules in Angular or micro frontends.

**Pros:**
- Highly testable and modular
- Excellent for large, layered applications

**Cons:**
- Too complex for small projects
- Not native to JS ecosystem

---

## 6. MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE

**Description:**  
Everything (frontend, backend, DB) is packaged as one deployable unit.

**Pros:**
- Easier to develop and test locally
- Simple to deploy

**Cons:**
- Scalability bottlenecks
- Difficult to update parts independently

---

## 7. MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE

**Description:**  
Application broken into small services that communicate via APIs.

**Use in Node.js:**
- REST/GraphQL services
- Messaging via RabbitMQ, Kafka

**Pros:**
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Fault isolation

**Cons:**
- DevOps complexity
- Distributed system debugging is harder

---

## 8. SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE

**Description:**  
Code runs in functions hosted by cloud providers (AWS Lambda, etc.)

**Use with React/Node.js:**
- API calls to serverless functions
- Auth, image processing, etc.

**Pros:**
- No server maintenance
- Scales automatically

**Cons:**
- Cold start issues
- Limited execution time

---

## 9. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Description:**  
Separates read and write operations into different models/services.

**Use in:**
- Backend APIs (Node.js)
- State management (Redux)

**Pros:**
- Optimized for reads and writes
- Better scalability

**Cons:**
- More complex design
- Needs sync strategies between command/query models

---

## 10. SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)

**Description:**  
Like microservices but with shared communication protocols (SOAP, XML).

**Pros:**
- Reusable service contracts
- Standardized interfaces

**Cons:**
- Heavier than REST/GraphQL
- Often overkill for frontend apps
