State Pattern
The State Pattern allows an object to dynamically change its behavior based on its internal state. Each state encapsulates specific logic and transitions to other states through defined rules. By switching between states, the object appears to “change its class” based on its current condition. This pattern promotes modularity, simplifies complex behavior changes, and enhances maintainability in your Node.js applications.

Key Use Cases
User authentication: Transitioning between “logged in,” “logged out,” “registering,” and “activating” states.
System status management: Representing “active,” “inactive,” “starting,” and “error” states with unique behaviors.
Workflow management: Modeling different stages in a process or task lifecycle.
Finite state machines (FSMs): Implementing complex state transitions and actions in various scenarios.
Game mechanics: Managing character states like “moving,” “attacking,” or “dead” with specific functionalities.
Code Samples
Basic State Object with Transitions

class Order {
  constructor(state) {
    this.state = state;
  }

  getState() {
    return this.state;
  }

  setState(newState) {
    this.state = newState;
    this.state.onEnter();
  }

  placeOrder() {
    this.state.placeOrder(this);
  }

  cancelOrder() {
    this.state.cancelOrder(this);
  }
}

class PlacedState {
  onEnter() {
    console.log('Order placed, awaiting confirmation.');
  }

  placeOrder(order) {
    console.log('Order already placed!');
  }

  cancelOrder(order) {
    order.setState(new CancelledState());
  }
}

class CancelledState {
  onEnter() {
    console.log('Order cancelled.');
  }

  placeOrder(order) {
    order.setState(new PlacedState());
  }

  cancelOrder(order) {
    console.log('Order already cancelled!');
  }
}

const order = new Order(new PlacedState());
order.placeOrder(); // Logs 'Order already placed!'
order.cancelOrder(); // Logs 'Order cancelled.'
State Machine Library Integration

const { StateMachine } = require('javascript-state-machine');

const fsm = new StateMachine({
  init: 'placed',
  states: {
    placed: {
      onEnter: () => console.log('Order placed'),
      transitions: {
        cancel: 'cancelled',
      },
    },
    cancelled: {
      onEnter: () => console.log('Order cancelled'),
    },
  },
});

const order = fsm.create();
order.cancel(); // Logs 'Order cancelled'
Pros
Modularity: Encapsulates different behaviors into distinct state objects.
Maintainability: Easier to reason about and modify state-specific logic.
Testability: Individual states can be tested in isolation.
Code organization: Promotes cleaner code structure for complex behavior changes.
Flexibility: Handles diverse state transitions and scenarios effectively.
Cons
Potential complexity: Managing numerous states and transitions can become intricate.
Overdesign risk: Not every situation requires the formal State pattern.
Learning curve: Understanding and applying the pattern effectively might require initial effort.
