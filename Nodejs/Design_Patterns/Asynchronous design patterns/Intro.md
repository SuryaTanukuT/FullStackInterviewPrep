Design patterns represent established, generalized solutions to commonly recurring problems encountered during software development. They are not pre-written code, but rather conceptual blueprints or templates adaptable to various contexts.

Employing design patterns offers numerous benefits, including:

Reusable solutions: Proven approaches to common problems, saving time and effort.
Improved code quality: Increased clarity, maintainability, and flexibility.
Enhanced communication: Shared vocabulary and understanding among developers.
In Node.js, where everything runs asynchronously, mastering asynchronous patterns is crucial. Here are some key ones:

1. Callbacks: The classic approach, functions passed as arguments to asynchronous operations get called upon completion. Can lead to “callback hell” with nested functions, but still widely used.

2. Promises: Offer a cleaner way to manage asynchronous flow. They represent the eventual result (success or failure) of an operation, allowing chaining and error handling.

3. Async/Await: Syntactic sugar on top of promises, making asynchronous code look more like synchronous code. Uses async functions and await statements for cleaner flow.
