Structural design patterns offer established approaches to structure and manage relationships between objects within an applicationâ€™s architecture. These patterns aim to enhance code clarity and maintainability by focusing on how objects collaborate and interact, rather than solely their creation.

Concretely, they achieve this through various mechanisms:

Adapter Pattern: Enables compatibility between objects with differing interfaces, facilitating seamless integration and communication across diverse components.
Decorator Pattern: Augments existing object functionality dynamically without altering its core structure, promoting flexible and modular object behavior.
Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface for interacting with complex systems, hiding internal intricacies and promoting ease of use.
Module Pattern: Encapsulates code within self-contained modules, each with private variables and functions, fostering code organization, reusability, and reduced coupling.
