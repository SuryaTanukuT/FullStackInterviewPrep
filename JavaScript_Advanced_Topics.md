# ðŸŒ´ JavaScript Advanced Implementations and Concepts

---

## 1. Chain Calculator
Implement a calculator that allows chained operations like:
```js
calc.add(5).multiply(2).subtract(3).value(); // 7
```

---

## 2. Execute Promises in Sequence
Chain an array of promise-returning functions so they run one after another.

---

## 3. Pipe and Compose Functions
- `pipe(f, g)(x)` = `g(f(x))`
- `compose(g, f)(x)` = `g(f(x))`

---

## 4. Custom Array Polyfills
Implement methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach` on `Array.prototype`.

---

## 5. Prototype and Inheritance
Demonstrate:
```js
function Animal() {}
Animal.prototype.speak = () => console.log("Sound");

function Dog() {}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
```

---

## 6. Call, Apply, and Bind
Manually implement:
```js
Function.prototype.myCall = function(ctx, ...args) {};
Function.prototype.myApply = function(ctx, argsArray) {};
Function.prototype.myBind = function(ctx, ...args) {};
```

---

## 7. Flatten a Nested Array
Recursive and iterative techniques to flatten deeply nested arrays.

---

## 8. Debounce Function
Delay function execution until after a period of inactivity.

---

## 9. Throttle Function
Ensure a function runs at most once in a defined time window.

---

## 10. Event Emitter
Implement custom `on`, `off`, and `emit` logic.

---

## 11. Debounce with Leading and Trailing
Control execution on leading and/or trailing edge of inactivity window.

---

## 12. MapLimit
Execute async tasks with a concurrency limit.

---

## 13. Cancelable Promise
Allow promise cancellation using external flags or controllers.

---

## 14. Typeahead with LRU Cache
Cache and evict results for frequently typed queries using LRU logic.

---

## 15. Compare Documents
Deep compare two document-like objects for differences.

---

## 16. Currying
Transform:
```js
f(a, b, c) => f(a)(b)(c)
```

---

## 17. Execute Tasks in Parallel
Run multiple async tasks simultaneously and wait for completion.

---

## 18. Find Matching Element in DOM
Traverse DOM to find element matching specific criteria.

---

## 19. Array Sorting
Implement custom sort logic (e.g., quicksort or merge sort).

---

## 20. Flatten a Complex Object
Convert nested objects into a flat key-value pair format.

---

## 21. Custom Event on Array Push
Trigger an event when an element is added to an array.

---

## 22. Deep Clone
Deeply copy nested objects, handling arrays and functions.

---

## 23. Serialize with JSON.stringify
Understand limitations (circular refs, functions) and stringify safely.

---

## 24. React DOM Rendering
Explain steps from virtual DOM diffing to actual DOM updates.

---

## 25. Retry Promise N Times
Retry failed promises with delay, up to N times.

---

## 26. Extend Event Emitter
Add wildcard, once-only, and conditional listeners.

---

## 27. Implement Promise.all
Wait for all promises to resolve or reject immediately on one failure.

---

## 28. Implement Promise.race
Resolve/reject as soon as the first promise resolves/rejects.

---

## 29. Implement Promise.any
Resolve on first fulfillment, ignore rejections unless all fail.

---

## 30. Implement Promise.allSettled
Wait for all to settle and return an array of results with status.

---
