‚úÖ Basic Kubernetes Knowledge (Required for most roles):
You should definitely know this level if you're applying for jobs involving deployment or microservices.

What is Kubernetes and why it's used

Key components: Pod, Deployment, Service, Namespace

Basic kubectl commands (e.g., get pods, describe, logs)

Writing simple YAML files for deployments

How your app (Node.js backend or React frontend) gets containerized and deployed to a cluster

How to debug logs or restart pods when your service breaks

‚öôÔ∏è Intermediate Knowledge (Good to have for mid/senior roles):
Needed if you work on larger apps or infrastructure-integrated teams.

ConfigMaps, Secrets

Liveness/Readiness probes

Resource limits & autoscaling

Helm basics (templating deployments)

CI/CD pipelines that deploy to K8s (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins with Kubernetes)

üö´ Advanced Kubernetes (Not required unless DevOps-focused):
Not expected unless you're handling infra:

Custom controllers/operators

Building K8s clusters from scratch

Network policies, service meshes (e.g., Istio)

Deep monitoring/logging/alerting setups
