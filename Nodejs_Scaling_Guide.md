# ⚙️ Node.js Design Considerations Based on Scale

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Scale

- **If your app serves 10 users**  
  → A single server and REST API will do.

- **If you’re handling 10M requests a day**  
  → Start thinking **load balancers**, **autoscaling**, and **rate limits**.

---

## 👨‍💻 Development Team Size

- **If one developer is building features**  
  → Skip the ceremony, **ship and test manually**.

- **If 10 devs are pushing daily**  
  → Invest in **CI/CD**, **testing layers**, and **feature flags**.

---

## 🧯 Downtime Impact

- **If your downtime just breaks one page**  
  → Add a banner and move on.

- **If your downtime kills a business flow**  
  → **Redundancy**, **health checks**, and **graceful fallbacks** are non-negotiable.

---

## 📡 API Usage

- **If you're just consuming APIs**  
  → Learn how to handle **400s and 500s**.

- **If you're building APIs for others**  
  → **Version** them, **document** them, **test** them, and **monitor** them.

---

## ⏱️ Performance Expectations

- **If your product can tolerate 3s of lag**  
  → Pick **clarity over performance**.

- **If users are waiting on each click**  
  → **Profiling**, **caching**, and **edge delivery** are part of your job.

---

## 🧠 Data Size

- **If your data fits in RAM**  
  → Store it in memory, use **simple maps**.

- **If your data spans terabytes**  
  → **Indexing**, **partitioning**, and **disk I/O patterns** start to matter.

---

Each scaling phase demands a different level of engineering. Choose wisely based on **context** and **impact**.
